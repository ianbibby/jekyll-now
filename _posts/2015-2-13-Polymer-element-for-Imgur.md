title: Polymer element for Imgur
---

Mucho Polymer love tonight! \<3 \<3

I've been experimenting with Polymer for a couple of weeks now and the development flow is just incredible.  It felt wrong to just keep all of this cool knowledge on my local machine or hidden in private repos, so without further ado here is my very first Polymer custom element:

Although not production ready, this only took a couple of hours and I can already imagine plugging this into a project that needs a quick image upload feature.

The Polymer team have done an amazing job with documenting the steps required for creating custom elements, so unless I find myself with some free time (lol) I'm going to just leave some link love here.
